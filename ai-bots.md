#### Overview of AI Bots ü§ñ

Formion's AI Bots utilize advanced artificial intelligence to automate trading strategies, analyze market trends, and make data-driven decisions. These bots are designed to operate on various exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, offering users seamless integration and enhanced trading performance.

#### Difference Between AI Bots and Smart Bots üîç

While both AI Bots and Smart Bots are designed to enhance trading efficiency, they operate in fundamentally different ways:

* **AI Bots:** Use advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time data analysis to make autonomous trading decisions. These bots are capable of learning, adapting to market conditions, and providing highly optimized trading strategies. AI Bots can be trained and upgraded over time.
* **Smart Bots:** Implement pre-defined trading strategies based on user inputs and TradingView indicators. They offer a simpler, rule-based approach to trading, making them suitable for traders who prefer a more hands-on strategy setup. Smart Bots do not use AI, cannot learn, and can only have their settings adjusted by the Formion team.

Our AI Bots are equipped to handle automated trading based on predefined strategies. Users can set their preferences, including risk tolerance and investment goals, and let the bots execute trades automatically. This ensures that trading opportunities are not missed due to human limitations.

Formion's AI Bots are powered by sophisticated algorithms that continuously analyze market data to provide actionable insights. These insights help users make informed decisions, enhancing their trading strategies and maximizing returns. The AI analyzes various indicators, including moving averages, RSI, and market sentiment.

#### Customizable Settings üõ†Ô∏è

Users can customize their AI Bot settings according to their preferences. The settings include options such as allowing others to copy trades, using LIMIT orders for TP/SL, mimicking the master's trade size, and more.
