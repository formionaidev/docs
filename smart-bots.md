# üíπ Smart Bots

## Overview of Smart Bots ü§ñ

Hemera's Smart Bots implement pre-defined trading strategies based on TradingView indicators. These bots operate on various exchanges, including Binance and Bybit. They offer a simpler, rule-based approach to trading, making them suitable for traders who prefer a more hands-on strategy setup. Currently, Smart Bots operate using long/short and close long/close short commands. Development is underway to implement a DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) model with multiple take-profit (TP) levels instead of a single close command.

#### Difference Between Smart Bots and AI Bots üß†

While both Smart Bots and AI Bots are designed to enhance trading efficiency, they operate in fundamentally different ways:

* **Smart Bots:** Implement pre-defined trading strategies based on user inputs and TradingView indicators. They offer a simpler, rule-based approach to trading, making them suitable for traders who prefer a more hands-on strategy setup. Smart Bots do not use AI, cannot learn, and can only have their settings adjusted by the Hemera team.
* **AI Bots:** Use advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time data analysis to make autonomous trading decisions. These bots are capable of learning, adapting to market conditions, and providing highly optimized trading strategies. AI Bots can be trained and upgraded over time.

Smart Bots are designed to execute trades automatically based on predefined strategies set by the Hemera Team. This allows traders to implement consistent strategies without the need for constant monitoring.

Right now we support BTC, SOL, RUNE and TRB symbols for Smart Bots on Bybit exchange only!\
\
You need to calculate your size properly  based on dragdown and risk.\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x46;or example let's assume you have 1k equity, you want to use 10x leverage, your margin should be somewhere 10-50% from your equity to be safe, so on this case it's around $10 to $50 which will make size around $100 up to $500 per symbol! If you want to use more symbols into the same account, you should use fixed size instead 'Portfolio % or cummulative profit'._\
\
_Note: If your risk tolerance is low do not use more then 10% position size, if you prefer more risk use from 20 to max 50%, do not use over 50% if you don't have enogh margin to cover potential losses._\
\
_Smart Bots are designed to work both in strong bull, strong bear market and durinng_ accumulation phase too!\

_**If you want to use full amount as position size ( 100% Portfolio percentage ) with 1k equity your size should be around 1k. ( if leverage is x10 then margin will be near $100) This setup is consider as High Risk. We do not recommend to use anything above 50% as position size but that's depend per user risk!**_
