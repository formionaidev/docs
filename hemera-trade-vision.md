## &#x20;**Trade with a Vision of Future - Hemera Trade Vision 🚀**



✨ **Hemera Vision Trade** is a revolutionary feature that brings a new level of speed, simplicity, and flexibility to the trading process. This feature allows users to trade directly from images of their trading analysis. Imagine being able to upload or forward an image of a chart or trading setup, and our system will automatically recognize key levels, like entry points, stop-loss, and take-profit targets, and then execute trades based on your preferences. It’s a game-changer for traders who rely on visual analysis and want to speed up their trading process.

📱 **But that’s not all**—Hemera VisionTrade also supports **text-based commands**. You can send trade instructions in different formats and languages directly through the platform or via our **Telegram bot**.&#x20;

💡 **Hemera VisionTrade** processes these commands and executes trades according to your predefined settings, making sure everything is done accurately and with no human errors.

🎯 We’re also planning to introduce more advanced trading strategies, like **DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)** and **grid trading**, to give users more options to customize their trading approach. These strategies will be easy to set up and manage, even for those who might not be familiar with complex trading systems.

🤖 Another big update to look forward to is our **AI-driven analysis and recommendations**. This feature will provide personalized insights based on market trends and your trading history, helping you make more informed decisions. Whether you’re focusing on long-term investments or short-term trades, our AI will be there to guide you.

These updates are designed to make trading on Hemera even more powerful and user-friendly. We’re excited to roll them out and believe they’ll significantly enhance the functionality of the platform, making it easier for you to trade smarter and more efficiently. 💪

#### 🔍 How It Works:

1. **Image Commands:**
   *   📸 **Image-Based Trading**: Users can either upload images of their trading charts or send text-based trading commands directly to the Hemera platform or through the Hemera Telegram bot. This flexibility allows traders to use the method that best suits their style, whether they prefer visual analysis or text-based commands.

2. ⌨️ **Text Commands**: Hemera VisionTrade supports various templates in different languages. \
   \
   Examples include:&#x20;

* 📈 "Buy BTC at 57499 for $100 size, DCA at 56000 for 30%, 54000 for 40%, 52000 for 30%, SL at 48322, TP at 59300 for 50%, 60100 for 10%, and the rest at 61300."
* 💹 "XRPUSDT Short Leverage x10 Entry 0.5929, Targets: 0.5797, 0.5525, 0.5243, SL 0.6162."
* 🔄 "Buy Bitcoin futures at $58200, stop loss at 56300, TP at 61000 and 63140."

To use text-based commands you need to go on Telegram bot @HemeraTradingBot and type command /trade like\
\
&#xNAN;**`/trade buy btc at 57k for 100$ size, sl 55k, tp at 60k`**

**3. Combining Images and Text**

📝 Hemera VisionTrade allows you to combine both **images and text commands** for a more detailed trading strategy. For example, you can upload a chart for visual analysis and include a text command for precise TP/SL levels.

* **Example**: Send an Ethereum chart and a text command like "Buy ETH at $1,800, SL at $1,750, TP at $2,000 for 50%, $2,100 for the rest." The system will combine the data from both sources and execute the trade.

#### 🎯 **Advanced Trading Strategies**

Hemera VisionTrade supports **advanced trading strategies** like:

**1. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)**

DCA allows you to **split your trade** into multiple levels, helping to lower your average entry price.

* **Example**:\
  "Buy BTC at $28,500 for 5%, then at $28,000 for $200, and finally at $27,500 for 3%."

**2. Take-Profit (TP) Strategies**

You can set multiple TP levels to optimize your exits, giving you better control over your profits.

* If you don’t specify percentages, Hemera will automatically distribute the exits evenly across the TP levels.
* You can customize your TP distribution to fit your strategy.
* **Example**:\
  "Set TP at $30,000 for 50%, $31,500 for 25%, and $32,000 for the remaining portion."



**Trade Configuration:**

* ⚙️ Before using Hemera VisionTrade, users set up their trading preferences. These include:
  * **Trade Amount**: 💵 Choose a fixed amount or a percentage of the portfolio.
  * **Leverage**: 📊 Define the leverage you want to apply to your trades.
  * **Take-Profit Strategy (TP Strategy)**: 🎯 Opt for a conservative approach (evenly distributed TP levels) or customize the distribution (e.g., different percentages at various TP levels).

1. **Automated Trade Execution:**
   * 🔄 Once the system processes the image or text command, Hemera VisionTrade extracts the necessary trading information—like entry levels, stop-loss, and take-profit targets—and automatically places the trades according to the user’s settings. This automation helps ensure precision and reduces the likelihood of human error.
